          <p>
            I graduated from the University of North Texas in 2013 with a
            Bachelors of Science for Hospitality Management. After graduating, I
            started working as a payment poster for a heart rate monitoring
            company and was able to rise in the ranks fairly quickly. After a
            year of helping my co workers and supervisors, I was promoted to
            being a supervisor. While I worked hard, I wanted to find a
            profession that I could be passionate about and continue learning. I
            looked into the field of Front-End Web Development and was
            immediately fascinated by the field. I knew this was my dream job
            and would take a lot of work to be successful. I decided to enroll
            in the

              >Thinkful</a
            >
            Software Engineer bootcamp. When I am not coding, you can usually
            find me hiking around Austin, playing board games and looking for
            new restaurants and food trucks to go eat at.
